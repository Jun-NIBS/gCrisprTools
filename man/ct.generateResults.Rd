\title{Calculate results of a crispr screen from a contrast}
\usage{
ct.generateResults(fit, annotation, RRAalphaCutoff = 0.1,
  permutations = 1000, multi.core = TRUE, contrast.term = NULL,
  scoring = c("combined", "pvalue", "fc"), permutation.seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \code{MArrayLM} containing, at minimum, a \code{t} slot with t-statistics from the comparison, 
a \code{df.residual} slot with the corresponding residuals fo the model fits, and an \code{Amean} slot with the respective mean abundances.}

\item{annotation}{An annotation file for the experiment, usually extracted with \code{ep.load.annot()} in ExpressionPlot. gRNAs are annotated by 
row, and must minimally contain columns \code{geneSymbol} and \code{geneID}.}

\item{RRAalphaCutoff}{A cutoff to use when defining gRNAs with significantly altered abundance during the RRAa aggregation step. If \code{scoring} is set 
to \code{pvalue} or \code{combined}, this parameter is interpreted as the maximum nominal p-value required to consider a gRNA's abundance meaningfully 
altered during the aggregation step. If \code{scoring} is \code{fc}, this parameter is interpreted as the proportion of the list to be considered 
meaningfully altered in the experiment (e.g., if \code{RRAalphaCutoff} is set to 0.05, only consider the rankings of the 5% most upregulated 
(or downregulated) gRNAs for the purposes of RRAa calculations).}

\item{permutations}{The number of permutations to use during the RRAa aggregation step.}

\item{multi.core}{Logical indicating whether to attempt to parallelize the analysis on multiple cores.}

\item{contrast.term}{If a fit object with multiple coefficients is passed in, a string indiating the coefficient of interest.}

\item{scoring}{The gRNA ranking method to use in RRAa aggregation. May take one of three values: \code{pvalue}, \code{fc},
or '\code{combined}'. \code{pvalue} indicates that the gRNA ranking statistic should be created from the (one-sided) p-values in the 
fit object. \code{fc} indicates that the ranks of the gRNA coefficients should be used instead, and \code{combined} indicates that 
that the coefficents should be used as the ranking statistic but gRNAs are discarded in the aggregation step based on the corresponding nominal 
p-value in the fit object.}

\item{permutation.seed}{numeric seed for permutation reproducibility. 
Default: \code{NULL} means to not set any seed. This argument is passed
through to \code{\link{ct.RRAaPvals}}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing gRNA-level and target-level statistics
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function that enables direct generation of target-level p-values from a crispr screen.
