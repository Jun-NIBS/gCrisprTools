\title{Generate a Contrast report from a pooled CRISPR screen}
\usage{
ct.makeContrastReport(eset, fit, sampleKey, results, annotation, identifier)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object containing, at minimum, a matrix of gRNA abundances extractable with the \code{exprs()} function and some named
phenodata extractable with \code{pData()}.}

\item{fit}{A fit object for the contrast of interest, usually generated with \code{limma::lmFit}.}

\item{sampleKey}{A sample key, supplied as an ordered factor linking the samples to experimental
variables. The \code{names} attribute should exactly match those present in \code{eset}, and the control set is assumed to be
the first \code{level}.}

\item{results}{A data.frame summarizing the results of the screen, returned by the function \code{\link{ct.generateResults}}.}

\item{annotation}{An annotation object for the experiment. See the man page for \code{ct.prepareAnnotation()} for details and example format.}

\item{identifier}{A character string to name the report and corresponding subdirectories. If provided, the final report will be called
'\code{identifier}.html' and will be located in a directory called \code{identifier} in the \code{outdir}. If \code{NULL}, a generic name including the
timestamp will be generated.}
}
\value{
The path to the generated html report.
}
\description{
This is a function to generate an html Contrast report for a CRISPR screen, focusing on contrast-level
analyses collected from other functions in \code{gCrisprTools}. It is designed to be used 'as-is', and analysts interested in 
using different functionalities of the various functions should do that outside of this wrapper script.
