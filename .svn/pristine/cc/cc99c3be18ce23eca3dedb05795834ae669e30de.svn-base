\usage{
ct.buildKeyFromAnnotation(ann, fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{ann}{A \code{data.frame} containing an annotation object with gRNA-level information encoded as rows. The \code{row.names} attribute should correspond to the individual gRNAs, and it should at minimum contain a column named "geneSymbol" indicating the corresponding gRNA target. Essentially a wrapper for \code{split()}.}

\item{fit}{A \code{fit} object containing data derived from the relevant gRNAs described in the supplied annotation object, accessible with \code{row.names()}.}
}
\value{
A new annotation data frame, where the "geneSymbol" column of \code{ann} has been factorized and only gRNAs contained in the fit object are included.
}
\description{
This function constructs a guide key from a supplied annotation file, usually extracted from ExpressionPlot with the \code{ep.load.annot()}
function. Originally this was something special, but now it is essentially the original annotation object in which the geneSymbol column has been
factorized. This is primarily used internally during a call to the \code{ct.generateResults()} function.
