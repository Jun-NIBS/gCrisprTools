\title{Calculate results of a crispr screen from a contrast}
\usage{
ct.generateResults(fit, annotation, RRAalphaCutoff = 0.05,
  permutations = 1000, multi.core = FALSE, contrast.term = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \code{MArrayLM} containing, at minimum, a \code{t} slot with t-statistics from the comparison,
a \code{df.residual} slot with the corresponding residuals fo the model fits, and an \code{Amean} slot with the respective mean abundances.}

\item{annotation}{An annotation file for the experiment, usually extracted with \code{ep.load.annot()} in ExpressionPlot. gRNAs are annotated by
row, and must minimally contain columns \code{geneSymbol} and \code{geneID}.}

\item{RRAalphaCutoff}{A nominal p-value cutoff to use when defining gRNAs with significantly altered abundance during the RRAa aggregation step.}

\item{permutations}{The number of permutations to use during the RRAa aggregation step.}

\item{multi.core}{Logical indicating whether to attempt to parallelize the analysis on multiple cores.}

\item{contrast.term}{If a fit object with multiple coefficients is passed in, a string indiating the coefficient of interest.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing gRNA-level and gene-level statistics
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function that enables direct generation of gene-level p-values from a crispr screen.
