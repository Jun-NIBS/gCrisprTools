\title{View CDFs of the ranked gRNAs or Targets present in a crispr screen}
\usage{
ct.guideCDF(eset, sampleNames = NULL, plotType = "gRNA",
  annotation = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet  object containing, at minimum, a matrix of gRNA abundances extractable with the exprs() function.}

\item{sampleNames}{An optional charvec of sample descriptors, with length equal to the number of samples in \code{eset}. The \code{names()} attribute
should exactly match the \code{colnames()} of the gRNA abundance matrix.}

\item{plotType}{A string indicating whether the individual guides should be displayed ("\code{gRNA}"), or if they should be aggregated into target-level
estimates ("\code{Target}") according to the \code{geneSymbol} column in the \code{annotation} object.}

\item{annotation}{An optional data.frame containing an annotation object to be used to aggregate the guides into targets, usually extracted with
\code{ep.load.annot()} in ExpressionPlot. gRNAs are annotated by row, and must minimally contain a column \code{geneSymbol} indicating the target elements.}
}
\value{
A CDF plot displaying the appropriate CDF curves on the default device.
}
\description{
This function generates a plot relating the cumulative proportion of reads in each sample of a crispr screen to the abundance rank of the
underlying guides (or Targets). The purpose of this algorithm is to detect potential distortions in the library composition
that might not be properly controlled by sample normalization (see also: \code{ct.stackedGuides()}).
