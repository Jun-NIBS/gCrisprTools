##' @title View a Barchart Summarizing Alignment Statistics for a Crispr Screen
##' @description This function displays the alignemnt statistics for a pooled Crispr screen, reported directly from an alignment statistic matrix. 
##' @param aln A numeric matrix of alignment statistics for a Crispr experiment, typically generated from ExpressionPlot with \code{ep.alignment.class.counts()}. 
##' Alternatively, a 4xN matrix of read counts, with columns indicating samples and rows indicating the number of "targets", "nomatch", "rejections", 
##' and "double_match" reads. Details about these classes may be found in the best practices vignette or as part of the report generated with 
##' \code{ct.makeReport()}. 
##' @return A grouped barplot displaying the alignment statistics for each sample included in the alignment matrix, which usually corresponds to all of 
##' the samples in the experiment.
