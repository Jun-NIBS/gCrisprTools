\usage{
ct.PantherPathwayEnrichment(summaryDF, pvalue.cutoff = 0.01, enrich = TRUE,
  organism = "human")
}
\arguments{
\item{summaryDF}{A dataframe summarizing the results of the screen, returned by the function \code{\link{ct.generateResults}}.}

\item{pvalue.cutoff}{A gene-level p-value cutoff defining targets of interest within the screen. Note that this is a 
nominal p-value cutoff to preserve end-user flexibility.}

\item{enrich}{Logical indicating whether to consider guides that are enriched (default) or depleted within the screen.}

\item{organism}{The species of the cell line used in the screen; this is passed to the \code{species} parameter 
in the \code{\link[multiGSEA]{getPantherGeneSetDb}} function.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of enriched pathways.
}
\description{
This function enables some limited geneset enrichment-type analysis of data derived from a pooled Crispr 
screen using the PANTHER pathway database. Specifically, it identifies the set of targets significantly enriched or 
depleted in a \code{summaryDF} object returned from \code{ct.generateResults} and compares that set to the remaining 
targets in the screening library using the \code{hyperGeometricTest()} function in \code{multiGSEA}.  

Note that many Crispr gRNA libraries specifically target biased sets of genes, often focusing on genes involved
in a particular pathway or encoding proteins with a shared biological property. Consequently, the enrichment results 
returned by this function represent the pathways containing genes disproportionately targeted *within the context 
of the screen*, and may or may not be informative of the underlying biology in question. This means that 
pathways not targeted by a Crispr library will obviously never be enriched within the positive target set regardless of 
their biological relevance, and pathways enriched within a focused library screen are similarly expected to partially 
reflect the composition of the library and other confounding issues (e.g., number of targets within a pathway). 
Analysts should therefore use this function with care. For example, it might be unsurprising to detect pathways related 
to histone modification within a screen employing a crispr library targeting epigenetic regulators.
