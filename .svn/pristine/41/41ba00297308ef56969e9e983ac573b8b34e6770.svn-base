\title{Normalize sample abundance estimates by median scaling}
\usage{
ct.medianScale(voom.obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{voom.obj}{An EList object with log-transformed count data in the $E slot (usually returned by voom).}
}
\value{
A renormalized voom object.
}
\description{
This function normalizes Crispr gRNA abundance estimates by equalizing the median values of the
distribution across samples. This function is essentially identical to the \code{normalizeMedianValues()} function
used internally by \code{voom()}, but does not involve a second log transformation of the data and is consequently
more stable in Crispr screens and other contexts where a sample median value may be low.
