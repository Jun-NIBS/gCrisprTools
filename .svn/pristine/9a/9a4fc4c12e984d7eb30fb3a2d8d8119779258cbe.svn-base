\title{Remove low-abundance reads and median scale a voom dataset}
\usage{
ct.filterVoom(voom.obj, trim = 500, ratio = 0.625)
}
\arguments{
\item{voom.obj}{An \code{EList} object containing, at minimum, a matrix of log-scale abundance estimates in the \code{E} slot.}

\item{trim}{The number of gRNAs to be trimmed from the top of the distribution before estimating the abundance range.}

\item{ratio}{Maximum abundance of contaminant gRNAs, expressed as a proportion of the trimmed range of each sample.}
}
\value{
An \code{EList} object, containing a trimmed and normalized data set.
}
\description{
This function removes gRNAs only present in very low abundance across all samples of a pooled Crispr
screening experiment, and then renormalizes the data appropriately. In most cases very low-abundance guides are the
result of low-level contamination from other libraries, and often distort standard normalization approaches. This
function trims gRNAs in a largely heuristic way, assuming that the majority of 'real' gRNAs within the library are
comparably abundant in at least some of the samples (such as unexpanded controls), and that contaminants are
present at negligible levels. Specifically, the function trims the \code{trim} most abundant guides from the upper
tail of each sample distribution, and then omits gRNAs whose abundances are always less than \code{ratio} of this
value. The distributions are then median scaled before
returning the data as a Voom-style \code{EList}.
