\title{Aggregation of P-value Ranks using a Beta Distribution and Alpha Cutoff}
\usage{
ct.RRAalpha(p, g.key, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A single column matrix of rank statistics, with row.names indicating the gRNA labels.}

\item{g.key}{data.frame with guide and gene names}

\item{alpha}{The alpha cutoff parameter, corresponding to the P-value threshold or fold change proportion at which gRNAs should no longer be considered to be 
differentially expressed. Alternatively, this can be provided as a named \code{list} or listlike object where the names correspond to the genes in \code{g.key} and the elements are integers indicating the number 
of significant gRNAs targeting it. When provided in list form, the elements of \code{alpha} should be provided in the order of the \code{levels()} of g.key$geneSymbol.}
}
\value{
A named list of target-level P-values, which are treated as a rho statistic in the permutation step.
}
\description{
This function is called internally as a single instance of the beta aggregation step in RRAa. Users should not interact with it directly. 
A previous version of this function accepted p-values, but that functionality has been moved upstream and now the expected input is a list of ranking statistics.
