\title{Normalize voom objects}
\usage{
ct.normalizeVoom(voom.object, method = c("scale", "slope"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{The normalization method to use. Currently only supports median scaling and slope normalization.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to the individual normalization methods.}

\item{voom.obj}{An EList object with log-transformed count data in the $E slot (usually returned by voom).}
}
\value{
A renormalized voom object.
}
\description{
This function normalizes Crispr gRNA abundance estimates contained in a voom-derived \code{EList}.
Currently two normalization methods are implemented: median scaling (via \code{ct.medianScale()}) and slope-based
normalization (via \code{ct.normalizeBySlope()}). Because of the peculiarities of pooled Crispr screening data,
these methods should be more stable than the endogenous methods used internally by \code{voom}. See the respective
man pages for further details about specific normalization approaches.
