\title{Normalize an ExpressionSet containing a Crispr Screen}
\usage{
ct.normalizeGuides(eset, method = c("scale", "slope"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object with integer count data extractable with \code{exprs()}.}

\item{method}{The normalization method to use. Currently only supports median scaling and slope normalization.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to the individual normalization methods.}
}
\value{
A renormalized ExpressionSet.
}
\description{
This function normalizes Crispr gRNA abundance estimates contained in an \code{ExpressionSet} object.
Currently two normalization methods are implemented: median scaling (via \code{limma::normalizeMedianValues()}) and slope-based
normalization (via \code{ct.normalizeBySlope()}). Because of the peculiarities of pooled Crispr screening data,
these methods should be more stable than the endogenous methods used downstream by \code{voom}. See the respective
man pages for further details about specific normalization approaches.
