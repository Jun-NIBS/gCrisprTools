\title{Create Batches of Null Permutations for a Crispr Screen}
\usage{
ct.RRAalphaBatch(p, g.key, alpha, result.environment, batch.size = 100,
  permutation.seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A single column matrix of rank statistics, with row.names indicating the gRNA labels.}

\item{g.key}{data.frame with guide and gene names}

\item{alpha}{The alpha cutoff parameter, corresponding to the P-value threshold or fold change proportion at which gRNAs should no longer be considered to be 
differentially expressed. Alternatively, this can be provided as a named \code{list} or listlike object where the names correspond to the genes in \code{g.key} and the elements are integers indicating the number 
of significant gRNAs targeting it. When provided in list form, the elements of \code{alpha} should be provided in the order of the \code{levels()} of g.key$geneSymbol.}

\item{result.environment}{The target environment containing the quasi-global variables incremented during the permutations in the child functions.}

\item{batch.size}{Number of iterations to deploy to each daughter process.}

\item{permutation.seed}{numeric seed for permutation reproducibility. Default is \code{NULL}, in which case no seed is set.}
}
\value{
An integer vector indicating the number of iterations in which each gene's score was better than those indicated in \code{result.environment$obs}.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function to partition batches of calls to \code{ct.RRAalpha()} for multicore processing. 
It is called internally as a single instance of the beta aggregation step in RRAa. Users should not interact with it directly.
