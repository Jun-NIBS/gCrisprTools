\title{Aggregation of P-value Ranks using a Beta Distribution and Alpha Cutoff}
\usage{
ct.alphaBeta(p.in, sigs)
}
\arguments{
\item{p.in}{A single column matrix of P-values, with row.names indicating the gRNA labels.}

\item{sigs}{The number of ranks to be considered.}
}
\value{
A numeric rho value corresponding to the minimum rank order P.
}
\description{
This function calculates an alpha-modified rho statistic from a set of ranks on the unit interval by comparing them to a uniform distribution. Specifically, the ranks are ordered and p-values calculated at each position in the ordered vector by comparison to a Beta distribution. The rho value returned is the smallest p-value identified in this comparison, only considering the first 'sigs'-ranked values. Should not be used by end users.
