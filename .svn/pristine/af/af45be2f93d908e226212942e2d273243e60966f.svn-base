\title{Generate a Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve from a CRISPR screen}
\usage{
ct.ROC(summaryDF, gene.list, stat = c("enrich.p", "deplete.p", "enrich.fc",
  "deplete.fc"), condense = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{summaryDF}{A dataframe summarizing the results of the screen, returned by the function \code{\link{ct.generateResults}}.}

\item{gene.list}{Something coercible to a character vector of target genes that are expected to score highly within the screen. 
All elements should be present within the \code{geneSymbol} column of \code{summaryDF}.}

\item{stat}{The statistic to use when ordering the genes. Must be one of \code{"enrich.p"}, \code{"deplete.p"}, \code{"enrich.fc"}, 
or \code{"deplete.fc"}.}

\item{condense}{Logical indicating whether the returned x and y coordinates should be "condensed", returning only the points at which 
the detected proportion of \code{gene.list} changes. If set to \code{FALSE}, the returned \code{x} and \code{y} vectors will explicitly
indicate the curve value at every position (useful for performing curve arithmetic downstream).}
}
\value{
A list containing the the x and y coordinates of the curve, and the AUC statistic.
}
\description{
Given a set of targets of interest, this function generates a ROC curve and associated statistics from the results of 
a CRISPR screen. Specifically, it orders the genes targeted in the screen by the specified statistic, and then plots the cumulative
proportion of positive hits on the y-axis. The corresponding vextors and Area Under the Curve (AUC) statistic are returned as a list.

Note that ranking statistics in CRISPR screens are (usually) permutation-based, and so some granularity in the rankings is expected. This 
function does a little extra work to ensure that hits are counted as soon as the requisite value of the ranking statistic is reached 
regardless of where the gene is located within the block of equally-significant genes. Functionally, this means that the drawn curve is
somewhat anticonservative in cases where the gene ranks are not well differentiated.
