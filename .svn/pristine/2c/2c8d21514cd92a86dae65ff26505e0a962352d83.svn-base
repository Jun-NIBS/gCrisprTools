\title{Normalize sample abundance estimates by the slope of the values in the a central range}
\usage{
ct.normalizeBySlope(eset, trim = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object containing, at minimum, count data accessible by \code{exprs}.}

\item{trim}{The proportion to be trimmed from each end of the distributionbefore performing the linear fit; algorithm defaults to 25% such that the
fit is performed on the interquartile range.}
}
\description{
This function normalizes Crispr gRNA abundance estimates by equalizing the slopes of the middle (logged) values of the
distribution across samples. Specifically, the algorithm ranks the gRNA abundance estimates within each sample and determines a relationship between
rank change and gRNA within a trimmed region of the distribution via a linear fit. It then adjusts each sample such that the center of the logged
abundance distribution is strictly horizontal and returns these values as normalized counts in the '\code{exprs}' slot of the input eset.
