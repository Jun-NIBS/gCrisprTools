\usage{
ct.alignmentChart(aln)
}
\arguments{
\item{aln}{A numeric matrix of alignment statistics for a Crispr experiment, typically generated from ExpressionPlot with \code{ep.alignment.class.counts()}. 
Alternatively, a 4xN matrix of read counts, with columns indicating samples and rows indicating the number of "targets", "nomatch", "rejections", 
and "double_match" reads. Details about these classes may be found in the best practices vignette or as part of the report generated with
