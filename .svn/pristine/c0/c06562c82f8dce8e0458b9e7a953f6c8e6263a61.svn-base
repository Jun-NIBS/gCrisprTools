\title{Aggregation of P-value Ranks using a Beta Distribution and Alpha Cutoff}
\usage{
ct.RRAalpha(p, g.key, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A single column matrix of P-values, with row.names indicating the gRNA labels}

\item{g.key}{data.frame with guide and gene names}

\item{alpha}{The alpha cutoff parameter, corresponding to the P-value threshold at which gRNAs should no longer be considered to be differntially expressed.}
}
\value{
A named list of target-level P-values, which are treated as a rho statistic in the permutation step.
}
\description{
This function is called internally as a single instance of the beta aggregation step in RRAa. Users should not interact with it directly. Should not be used by end users.
