\title{Display the log2 fold change estimates and associated standard deviations of the guides targeting the top
candidates in a crispr screen}
\usage{
ct.topTargets(fit, summaryDF, annotation, ntargets = 10, enrich = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \code{MArrayLM} containing, at minimum, a \code{coefficents} slot with coefficients from the comparison,
and a \code{stdev.unscaled} slot with the corresponding standard deviation of the coefficent estimates. The \code{row.names} attribute
should ideally match that which is found in \code{annotation}.}

\item{summaryDF}{A data.frame summarizing the results of the screen, returned by the function \code{\link{ct.generateResults()}}.}

\item{annotation}{An annotation file for the experiment, usually extracted with \code{ep.load.annot()} in ExpressionPlot. gRNAs are annotated by
row, and must minimally contain a column \code{geneSymbol}.}

\item{ntargets}{The number of targets to display.}

\item{enrich}{Logical indicating whether to display guides that are enriched (default) or depleted within the screen.}
}
\value{
An image on the default device.
}
\description{
This is a function for displaying the top candidates from a crispr screen, using the information summarized
in the corresponding \code{fit} and the output from \code{ct.generateResults()}. The results are plotted as a
classed scatterplot of the top \code{ntargets} upregulated and downregulated targets in the screen, as indicated by the
relevant p-values contained in the \code{summaryDF}. The fold change and standard deviation estimates for each gRNA targeting each target
(extracted from the \code{coefficients} and \code{stdev.unscaled} slot of \code{fit}) are plotted on the y axis. Targets are
selected on the basis of their gene-level P-values; in the case of ties, they are ranked on the basis of the median gRNA
fold change.
