\usage{
ct.normalizeGuides(eset, method = c("scale", "slope", "controlScale",
  "controlSpline"), annotation = NULL, sampleKey = NULL, plot.it = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object with integer count data extractable with \code{exprs()}.}

\item{method}{The normalization method to use.}

\item{annotation}{The annotation object for the library, required for the methods employing nontargeting controls.}

\item{sampleKey}{An (optional) sample key, supplied as an ordered factor linking the samples to experimental
variables. The \code{names} attribute should exactly match those present in \code{eset}, and the control set is assumed to be
the first \code{level}.}

\item{plot.it}{Logical indicating whether to plot the ranked log2 gRNA count distributions before and after normalization.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to the individual normalization methods.}
}
\value{
A renormalized ExpressionSet.
}
\description{
This function normalizes Crispr gRNA abundance estimates contained in an \code{ExpressionSet} object.
Currently four normalization methods are implemented: median scaling (via \code{limma::normalizeMedianValues()}), slope-based
normalization (via \code{ct.normalizeBySlope()}), scaling to the median of the nontargeting control values (via 
\code{ct.normalizeNTC()}), and spline fitting to the distribution of the nontargeting gRNAs (via \code{ct.normalizeSpline()}). 
Because of the peculiarities of pooled Crispr screening data, these implementations may be more stable than the endogenous methods 
used downstream by \code{voom}. See the respective man pages for further details about specific normalization approaches.
