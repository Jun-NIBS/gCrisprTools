\title{Generate a QC report from a pooled CRISPR screen}
\usage{
ct.makeQCReport(eset, sampleKey, annotation, aln, identifier, lib.size)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object containing, at minimum, a matrix of gRNA
abundances extractable with the \code{exprs()} function and some named 
phenodata extractable with \code{pData()}.}

\item{sampleKey}{A sample key, supplied as an ordered factor linking the 
samples to experimental variables. The \code{names} attribute should 
exactly match those present in \code{eset}, and the control set is assumed
to be the first \code{level}.}

\item{annotation}{An annotation object for the experiment. See the man page 
for \code{ct.prepareAnnotation()} for details and example format.}

\item{aln}{A numeric alignment matrix, where rows correspond to "targets", 
"nomatch", "rejections", and "double_match", and where columns correspond 
to experimentasl samples.}

\item{identifier}{A character string to name the report and corresponding 
subdirectories. If provided, the final report will be called 
'\code{identifier}.html' and will be located in a directory called 
\code{identifier}. If \code{NULL}, a generic name including the timestamp
will be generated.}

\item{lib.size}{- numeric vector of size factor adjusted library sizes named
after eset's columns.}
}
\value{
The path to the generated html report.
}
\description{
This is a function to generate an html QC report for a CRISPR 
  screen, focusing on experiment-level and library-level analyses collected 
  from other functions in \code{gCrisprTools}. It is designed to be used 
  'as-is', and analysts interested in using different functionalities of the
  various functions should do that outside of this wrapper script.
