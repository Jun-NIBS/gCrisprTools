\title{Visualization of Raw gRNA Count Densities}
\usage{
ct.rawCountDensities(eset, class.var)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object containing, at minimum, count data accessible by exprs() and some phenoData.}

\item{class.var}{The name of a column in the phenoData slot of eset that can be used to group samples. Coerced to a factor.}
}
\description{
This function plots the per-sample densities of raw gRNA read counts on the log10 scale. The curve colors are assigned based on a user-
specified column of the pData contained in the ExpressionSet. This function is primarily useful to determine whether libraries are undersequenced
(low mean raw gRNA counts), or if PCR artifacts may be present (subset of extremely abundant guides, multiple gRNA distribution modes). In most
well-executed experiments the majority of gRNAs will form a tight distribution around some reasonably high average read count (hundreds of reads),
at least among the control samples. Excessively low raw count values can compromise normalization steps and subsequent estimation of gRNA levels, especially
in screens in which most gRNAs have minimal effects on cell viability.
